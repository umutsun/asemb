# Embeddings Manager UX Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Table Selection State Not Reset After Cancellation
- **Problem**: After cancelling a migration, users couldn't select new tables
- **Solution**: Added proper state cleanup in `abortMigration()` and `stopMigration()` functions
- **Files**: `page.tsx`

### 2. Migration State Not Properly Cleared
- **Problem**: Migration state persisted after cancellation
- **Solution**: Created `cleanupMigrationState()` function to properly reset all migration-related state
- **Files**: `page.tsx`

### 3. UI Controls Not Re-enabled
- **Problem**: Table selection checkboxes and controls remained disabled after migration completion
- **Solution**: Added proper disabled state management for all controls based on `progress?.status === 'processing'`
- **Files**: `page.tsx`

### 4. Missing API Endpoints
- **Problem**: Frontend was polling `/api/embeddings/progress` but endpoint didn't exist
- **Solution**: Created missing API endpoints:
  - `/api/embeddings/progress/route.ts`
  - `/api/embeddings/pause/route.ts`
- **Files**: `progress/route.ts`, `pause/route.ts`

### 5. Race Conditions in State Updates
- **Problem**: Polling could override user actions and cause inconsistent state
- **Solution**: Improved polling logic with better dependency management and state comparison
- **Files**: `page.tsx`

### 6. Memory Leaks and Cleanup Issues
- **Problem**: useEffect hooks weren't properly cleaning up
- **Solution**: Added proper cleanup functions and component unmount handling
- **Files**: `page.tsx`

## Key Changes

### State Management
- Added `cleanupMigrationState()` function for consistent state reset
- Proper cleanup of all migration-related state variables
- Component-level cleanup useEffect

### UI Controls
- Table selection checkboxes now properly disabled during processing
- "Tümünü Seç/Tümünü Kaldır" button disabled during processing
- All form controls respect processing state

### API Endpoints
- Added progress polling endpoint
- Added pause functionality endpoint
- Fixed API endpoint URLs to use consistent base path

### Error Handling
- Improved error handling in migration functions
- Better user feedback for all operations

## Testing

The complete migration flow has been tested:
- ✅ Start migration
- ✅ Pause migration
- ✅ Continue migration
- ✅ Cancel migration
- ✅ State resets properly after cancellation
- ✅ UI controls re-enabled after completion/cancellation
- ✅ Build succeeds for both frontend and backend
